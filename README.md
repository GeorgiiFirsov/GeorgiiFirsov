## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Georgy Firsov**. Currently I'm located in Moscow, Russian Federation. My main job is junior software engineer in the area of system programming in the area of security. In addition I improve my knowledge in machine learning (in university) and web development (as my own additional activity).

### :mortar_board: Education
I'm a student of [National Research Nuclear University MEPhI](https://mephi.ru/) since 2017. After receiving a bachelor's degree (program engineering) I'll continue my eduction to receive a master's degree. Currently my research area is time series analyzis and machine learning. You can look at some repositories about it in my profile.

### :office: Work
I work in [Security Code Ltd.](https://www.securitycode.ru/) in Moscow in HQ of the company. I'm a junior software engineer, but more oficially my job title is "junior developer". I'm working in Secret Net Studio department. [Secret Net Studio](https://www.securitycode.ru/products/secret-net-studio/) is an information security system, that provides own discretionary access control, mandat access control, integrity checking, own logon module, etc. I'm working in base protection group that develops a core of the whole system. 

### :zap: Tools and technologies
My main programming language is **C++**, I'm familiar with core C++, STL, Win32 API, complex template metaptogramming, compile time calculations and multithreadig. Also I use pure Win32 API to write applications for Windows (including GUI applications), but sometimes I use some MFC and ATL classes to write apps more easily and quickly. 

The second language I often use is **Python**, usually I choose it for some machine learning tasks, TSA and neural networks. Well, writing in Python is more about my hobby for now, because my main tasks on work require writing in C++.

Set of my main technologies is listed below:

### :information_source: Some additional info
In my free time I like to study some knowledge about C++ as far as it is my main programming language. For instanse I research compiler internals, develop some tricks. You can find several articles on my [web-page](https://georgyfirsov.github.io/) ([english version](https://georgyfirsov.github.io/en/)). There are some articles about a process of developing of my repositories, that I consider to be interesting to read.

Moreover my interests spread onto the area of compilers theory, programming languages, automata theory, computer networks, cryptography and information security. I also dig into \*nix systems to know how they work internally. In the area of weak artifical intelligence I'm interested in machine learning algorithms (regression, classification, etc.), time series modelling and forecasting, building neural networks for classification tasks. Another area of IT, I'm improving my skills in, is web development (with respect to security).
